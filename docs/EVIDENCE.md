   - Search for unique function names
   - Use: `site:beyondchats.com "[unique string from my code]"`

2. **GitHub Search:**
   - Search for copied code across GitHub
   - Monitor for forks without attribution

3. **Web Monitoring:**
   - Check BeyondChats' production site
   - Look for my specific implementations
